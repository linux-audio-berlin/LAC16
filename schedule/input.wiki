This is the miniLAC schedule. Please read up on how to use the [[Template:Schedule|schedule template]], before filling in your timeslot(s).

= Friday =
Friday is planned as a meet-and-greet day. Arrive in the late afternoon/ early evening and grab a drink with us at [[c-base]].

There is no program planned, but you can drop by after 20:00h.


== Organisation ==
This is the helper's table to organize shifts! [[Volunteer]]!

We'll probably require help setting things up and doing last-minute arrangements!
Expect to be able to help us from around 15:00h on.
